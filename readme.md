# PICO's mods for Factorio
A collection of not-so-radical mods made for myself.

- [PICO's Combat Pack](./pico-combat) extends the vanilla weapons and defenses (I also plan a small obverhaul of combat mechanics).
- [PICO's Clean Production Pack](./pico-greenery) extends production chains with better less-polluting options (also includes some QoL stuff).

## Licensing
So far, I have not paid enough attention to the licensing of the different assets I use, but my Lua code is available under the MIT license.
