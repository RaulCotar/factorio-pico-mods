# ImRC's Combat Pack

### Concrete walls

Tier 2 walls made with concrete and iron plates. Slightly more expensive to produce, but offer more sensible and highly configurable damage resistances (e.g. walls shouldn't be damaged by poison). Graphics from [Enhanced Walls](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/enhanced-walls) by Ink_Dash.

### Cluster rockets

By reseraching Cluster rocketry you unlock the cluster variants of vanilla rockets. They are 2/3 scale rockets with a faster fire rate and a slightly higher DPS than the normal ones. They are faster, less accurate and can be free-fired (they target locations not entities). Their main appeal is being more fun to use. Inspired from [Lily's Micromissiles](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/lilys-mm) by IonShield.

### The chainsaw - WIP
The chainsaw is a melee weapon with very short reach and consumes fuel, but in return deals very high amounts of damage to anything that stands in front of it. It is especially useful when you get swarmed by a group of biters, or if you enjoy ripping and tearing through your enemies.

## TODO:
- high priority:
  - fix the chainsaw
- low priority:
  - darken wall graphics to make them more similar to concrete
- future plans:
  - molotov (throwable, flame puddle area effect)
  - corvette (boat, machinegun + rocket launcher)
  - baloon (flying vehicle, flamethrower + grenade dropper, fireball on death)
